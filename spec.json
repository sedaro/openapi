Email us at support@sedarotech.com\n\n### Known Issues\n\n- Currently the documentation for 200 responses to Block create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations is incorrect.\nThis is due to an issue with our documentation generator.  Under each Block Group, the documentation will show `name`,\n`collection`, and `data` keys.  In reality, this level does not exist and should be skipped.  See the schema under the\n`data` key of a Template's Block Group for the correct schema of such Block Group.\n- Error responses are most specific than what is shown throughout the documentation.  A 4xx or 5xx error will be returned\nin all error cases.  Only a `200` status indicates success.  See a given error response for additional details.\n","version":"3.3.5","x-logo":{"url":"https://api.sedaro.com/static/multimedia/logo_secondary_02242022.png","backgroundColor":"#FAFAFA","altText":"Sedaro Satellite API

These Templates then define\nreusable, instantiatable definitions for an Agent or Scenario.  To recap, an Agent is an actor within a simulation and a \nScenario defines the simulation (including the Agents that make it up and the Templates that define them). Therefore, \nAgent Templates capture the model for a system while Scenario Templates capture the instantiation of differentiated Agents,\nthe resolution of their abstract \"Targets\", and the configuration of the simulation clock.\n\nA Template is made up of Blocks - each existing within a Block Group inside of the Template.  A Block Group is much like\na traditional database table but with more flexibility.  The following is the default Scenario Template:\n\n```python\n{\n    'ClockConfig': {}, # Block Group\n    'Agent': {}, # Block Group\n    'Orbit': {}, # Block Group\n    'clockConfig': None, # root property (in this case a relation to a ClockConfig Block that defines the start and stop time of the simulation)\n}\n```\n\nTemplates are modified by creating, updating, and deleted their Blocks using the \"Blocks\" endpoints below.\n\n#### Template Composition\n\n##### Scenario Template\n\n- [Agent](#tag/Agent)\n- [ClockConfig](#tag/Clock-Config)\n- [Orbit](#tag/Orbit)\n\n##### Agent Template\n\n*All Blocks not referenced above under \"Scenario Template\"*.

If omitted, defaults to the minimum timestamp in the dataset.\n- `stop`: The stop time of the window in MJD. If omitted, defaults to the maximum timestamp in the dataset.\n- `binWidth`: (optional) The bin width to use to down-sample the data.  If omitted, data will be full resolution.\n\nExample request: `GET: /data/?id=<id>&start=<start>&stop=<stop>&binWidth=<binWidth>`\n\n#### Response\n\nData is returned from a query in the following format:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n    \"series\": { \n        <streamId>: [\n            [<timestamp1::MJD>, <timestamp2::MJD>, ...],\n            {\n                <agentId>: {\n                    <blockId>: {\n                        <stateVariableA>: [<valueA1>, <valueA2>, ...],\n                        <stateVariableB>: [<valueB1>, <valueB2>, ...],\n                        ...\n                    },\n                    <stateVariableC>: [<valueC1>, <valueC2>, ...]\n                },\n                ...\n            }\n        ],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that a \"Stream\" is a set of state variables that share the same timestamps.  Specifically, the values in a Stream \ncorrespond to a modsim Engine of a particular Agent.  The `series` object contains a key for each stream in the data set.\nThe value of each stream key is a 2-element array.  The first element is an array of timestamps - the X-axis for all variables\nin the stream.  The second element is an object containing the state variables that compose the stream.  The state variables \nare grouped under an Agent ID and then a Block ID (if applicable).  The value of each entry is an array of values that aligns\nwith the timestamp vector.\n"}],"x-tagGroups":[{"name":"Repositories","tags":["Branches"]},{"name":"Simulation","tags":["Jobs"]},{"name":"Data","tags":["Data"]},{"name":"Agent Blocks","tags":["Solar Panel","Angular Velocity Sensor","Condition","Lock Pointing Mode","Battery Pack","GPS Algorithm","Surface","FOV Constraint","Solar Array","Satellite","Target Group Vector","Max Align Pointing Mode","MEKF Algorithm","Target Group","Solar Cell","Ground Target","Body Frame Vector","Triad Algorithm","Target Vector","Rectangular Field Of View","Component","Constant Load","Celestial Target","Load State","Sliding Mode Algorithm","Reaction Wheel","Thermal Interface","Position Sensor","Spherical Fuel Tank","EKF Algorithm","Passive Pointing Mode","Space Target","Bus Regulator","Local Vector","Averaging Algorithm","Thermal Interface Material","Cooler","Circular Field Of View","Operational Mode","Con Ops","Spherocylinder Fuel Tank","Surface Material","Vector Sensor","Temp Controller State","Subsystem","Celestial Vector","Optical Attitude Sensor","Heater","Battery","Static Thrust Control Algorithm","Thruster","PID Algorithm","Topology","Magnetorquer","Direction Sensor","Battery Cell","Group Condition","Fuel Reservoir"]},{"name":"Scenario Blocks","tags":["Clock Config","Agent","Orbit"]}]}
